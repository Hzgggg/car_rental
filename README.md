This System mainly includes two modules, the order module and the car management module;
The order module is user-oriented, providing users with the functions of creating, canceling, paying, and completing car rental orders;
The car management module is oriented to administrators, who can add, modify, and delete cars.

<b>P.S</b>

Due to time constraints and task requirements, there is no implementation of user modules in the system, and user-related data only serve the main process.
